# Delivery process advisor

This project follows the delivery process advisor: a project-local process for
turning an idea into software that is clear enough to build. Its normative
documentation lives under `docs/`. Catalogs define the decisions to address,
their dependencies, and the usual order. This file provides shared reading
guidance and navigation, and says how sessions, tickets, handoffs, and deferred
work fit the process.

## Using project documentation

The code is the source of truth for what is implemented. Existing behavior may
be undocumented; that alone creates no requirement to change it or document it.
For work specified in documentation but not yet implemented, the relevant
accepted decisions are part of its spec: read and follow them when planning,
building, or reviewing it. Use the reading guidance below to find them.

Before explaining, planning, or changing behavior the project may already
have, read the code first, then the documentation, and answer from both,
because documentation read alone can describe a behavior the code has since
replaced. Where the two agree, explain the implementation through the
documents. Where they contradict each other, say so, keep the implementation,
and propose bringing the documentation in line with the code; the
contradiction alone changes no document and proves no bug, and the user may
instead confirm the documentation as the intended direction. A ticket or
request that contradicts an accepted decision is likewise raised before acting
on it.

Accepted artifacts record settled decisions; they do not prove that those
decisions are implemented. Proposals and artifacts needing review do not
establish accepted inputs; sources inform decisions without establishing rules.
A passage read without its routing envelope is not yet an input, since a slice
of a proposal reads like a slice of an accepted rule: before planning, building,
reviewing, or telling the user what the project decided on it, read the
document's title, status line, and Scope, and its Dependencies when the passage
is a decision that relies on others.
An artifact records decisions established with the user, including choices made
within their explicit delegation. Choices made without that agreement or
delegation remain proposed. The user may change direction; the advisor's advice
creates no additional permission step or deviation record. The full document,
status, dependency, and acceptance rules are in
[`docs/advisor-docs.md`](docs/advisor-docs.md).

## Where things are

- [`docs/advisor-docs.md`](docs/advisor-docs.md) defines common documentation
  rules and routes subjects to their owning authority.
- `docs/<authority>/advisor-<authority>.md` defines that authority's boundary
  and links to its catalogs. Project artifacts live beside it; feature artifacts
  live under `docs/features/<feature-slug>/<authority>/`.
- Project and feature catalogs for Product, Frontend, Architecture, and
  Implementation are separate `advisor-<authority>-project.md` and
  `advisor-<authority>-feature.md` files. Other authorities keep one demand-driven
  catalog in their boundary file.
- [`docs/features/advisor-features.md`](docs/features/advisor-features.md)
  defines feature structure and routes each phase to its boundary and catalog.
- `GLOSSARY.md` holds the project's vocabulary; `docs/adr/` holds decision
  records explaining important choices. Neither is an artifact or phase.

## Sessions, tickets, and handoffs

- **Grill-with-docs sessions**, started by `/grill-with-docs` or by a request to
  write, fill in, or accept a document under `docs/`, record decisions in the
  advisor's artifacts as they settle. Before the first question, read
  `docs/advisor-docs.md` and follow its
  [session procedure](docs/advisor-docs.md#grill-with-docs-sessions).
- **Ticket breakdowns and implementation.** Before drafting tickets or building,
  put to the user, each with a recommended answer, the decisions the work
  depends on that neither an accepted artifact, its ticket, nor the
  conversation settles.
- **Delegation.** A brief that delegates work names the documents that own its
  subject, with their status, because a delegate finds documents through its
  brief before anything else.
- **Handoffs** name the decisions settled in the conversation but not yet
  written to their artifacts, suggesting `/grill-with-docs` to record them, and
  leave work that can wait beyond the next session to `deferred` issues.
- **Deferred work**, a question, idea, or concern that can wait beyond the next
  session, is an open `deferred` issue in the tracker configured by
  `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` (if it is missing, ask the user to run
  `/setup-matt-pocock-skills`), stating what to revisit, why it can wait, and
  when to revisit it. Open one directly, or publish a deferred breakdown through
  `to-tickets` with `deferred` in place of `ready-for-agent`. Before a
  grill-with-docs session, a ticket breakdown, a propagation, a migration, or
  next-work advice, read the open `deferred` issues relevant to it. Close an
  issue with a link to its answer once that answer is written in its artifact.
  Legacy `docs/deferred/` files are an archive.

## Reading guidance

Open a known relevant artifact directly. To find what the project decided on a
subject, search inside the folders that hold it: `docs/<authority>/` for shared
rules, `docs/features/<feature-slug>/` for a feature, `docs/adr/` for the
reasons behind a decision; then follow the links those documents carry. For
feature work, search the authority folders as well as the feature's, because
shared rules bind every feature. The folders already name subject and owner,
so this reaches the passage at a fraction of the cost of reading the common
rules first. When a search finds nothing, the subject may be documented in
other words: open the authority's boundary file or the authority table in
`docs/advisor-docs.md`. To place a document, select its authority in that table
and read the authority's boundary; to learn which decisions an action must
cover, read only the catalog the action needs. Do not load the documentation
tree as general context.

Follow relevant Dependencies, Review blocks, and linked decision passages.
Treat filenames and markers as routing information, not evidence of what a
document establishes.

Look for sources in `docs/sources/` and `docs/<authority>/sources/`. For feature
work, also inspect `docs/features/<feature-slug>/sources/` and
`docs/features/<feature-slug>/<authority>/sources/`. Inspect filenames and
opening lines to choose relevant full reads. A source has no required format.

Look for experiment material in the `experiments/` subfolders of these sources
locations. See the
[experiment placement convention](docs/advisor-docs.md#where-material-that-is-not-a-document-sits).

Recognize advisor scaffolds and catalogs by their fixed names. Unmarked project
documents may be relevant context; reading them does not adopt them as advisor
artifacts.

Cite the documents and passages supporting conclusions drawn from documentation.
Disclose unread material that could affect those conclusions.

Explain the project's documentation conventions from its local advisor files.
For the advisor's broader design and rationale, direct the user to its own
repository: <https://github.com/SebastianoTomasi/delivery-process-advisor>.
